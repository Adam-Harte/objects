    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Objects are a core data structure in JavaScript that reference a place in
      memory containing properties (variables) and methods (functions). This
      allows us to group related data and split code into logical pieces.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding, Modifying and Deleting Properties</h3>
    <p>
      You can add, modify and delete properties/methods of an object after it
      has been created. By using the dot notation we can create new properties
      by defining a new property name after the dot notation e.g.
      object.newProp. We can also use the dot notation to modify properties by
      defining the property to modify with the dot notation and initializing it
      to a new value e.g. object.prop = new value. We can delete properties with
      the delete key word followed by the property e.g. delete object.prop.
      Instead of deleting the property from the object you can also modify the
      value to be null so rather than removing it from the object we are simply
      resetting it so it exists in case it is needed again later.
    </p>
    <h3>Bracket Notation</h3>
    <p>
      Objects convert property keys to strings and therefore we can create key
      names using strings that wouldnt normally convert correctly e.g. one two
      rather than oneTwo. We can then access these keys via bracket notation []
      as dot notation would not allow us access as the spacing would break the
      declaration.
    </p>
    <h3>Shorthand Property Syntax</h3>
    <p>
      You can declare object properties with a shorthand syntax when you have
      variables already defined with the property name you want assigned to your
      object. Then rather than needing a colon with the value you can just pass
      the property name and it will automatically pull the value from the
      variable into that property.
    </p>
    <h3>For In Loops</h3>
    <p>
      The for in loop lets us loop through the keys of an object similar to for
      of where we can loop through values.
