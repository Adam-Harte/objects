    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Objects are a core data structure in JavaScript that reference a place in
      memory containing properties (variables) and methods (functions). This
      allows us to group related data and split code into logical pieces.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding, Modifying and Deleting Properties</h3>
    <p>
      You can add, modify and delete properties/methods of an object after it
      has been created. By using the dot notation we can create new properties
      by defining a new property name after the dot notation e.g.
      object.newProp. We can also use the dot notation to modify properties by
      defining the property to modify with the dot notation and initializing it
      to a new value e.g. object.prop = new value. We can delete properties with
      the delete key word followed by the property e.g. delete object.prop.
      Instead of deleting the property from the object you can also modify the
      value to be null so rather than removing it from the object we are simply
      resetting it so it exists in case it is needed again later.
